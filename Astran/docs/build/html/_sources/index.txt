Astran's Documentation
======================

Automatic Synthesis of Transistor Networks (**ASTRAN**), is a free, open source, physical synthesis framework for Mac and Linux. It supports automatic layout generation of CMOS cells from a transistor level netlist description in SPICE format. Area overhead compared to high quality hand-made standard-cells layouts is 3.7% on average. Its functionality is being extended to produce complete circuit layouts. Features include transistor sizing, floorplanning, cell placement, and routing. The framework is very modular and new contributions to this project are welcome.
